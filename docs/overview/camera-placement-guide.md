# **Camera Placement Guide**

> Use your existing camera to integrate with VisionAI platform 

Proper camera placement is essential to ensure that all areas of the workplace are adequately covered.


## General guiudelines

When positioning cameras for various use situations, take into account the following general guidelines: 

- Lighting: Install cameras underneath a light fittings so that they do not obscure the cameras.
- Backlighting: Avoid mounting cameras near to window or other areas to protect from backlighting issue. It affects image quality.
- Local policies: Take into account local placement policies and laws.
- Authorization: The installation of cameras should be authorized by a designated person or department within the organization. 
- Maintenance: Cameras should be regularly maintained and checked to ensure they are functioning properly. The policy should specify who is responsible for maintaining the cameras and how often they should be checked.

!!! note
    Overall, it's important to develop local policies for camera mounting that balance the need for surveillance with the protection of privacy rights. The policies should be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure they remain relevant and effective.

## Key factors 

When setting up cameras there are three key factors to consider: 

1. Camera height
2. Camera-to-focal-point distance, and 
3. Camera angle relative to the floor plane.

It's crucial to identify the direction in which the majority of people are walking in relation to the camera's field of view. This direction is important for optimal system performance.

### Camera height

Camera height is an important consideration when determining the field of view for workplace safety cameras. For example, cameras should be placed high enough to capture the entire area of interest, but not so high that the camera view becomes distorted or difficult to interpret. Additionally, the height of the camera should take into account any obstacles or obstructions that may block the camera's field of view.

### Camera-to-focal-point distance
The camera-to-focal-point distance is the distance between the camera lens and the focal point of the area being monitored. This distance is important because it determines the level of detail captured by the camera. If the camera is too far away from the focal point, the resulting image may lack the necessary detail to accurately capture safety hazards or other important information.

This distance is measured on the floor plane.

From above, it looks like this:

The following illustration simulates camera views from the closest and farthest camera-to-focal-point distances.

### Camera angle mounting ranges
The angle of the camera relative to the floor plane is important for capturing accurate footage of safety hazards and other workplace activities. For example, cameras should be positioned to capture a wide field of view, but not at such an extreme angle that the resulting image becomes distorted or difficult to interpret. Additionally, the angle of the camera should take into account the direction that people are walking in relation to the camera field of view, as this can impact the performance of the system.

The following illustration simulates camera views using the leftmost (-) and rightmost (+) mounting angle recommendations:

It's important to carefully consider camera height, camera-to-focal-point distance, and camera angle relative to the floor plane. Taking these factors into account can help ensure that cameras are positioned to capture accurate footage of workplace hazards and other important safety information.
